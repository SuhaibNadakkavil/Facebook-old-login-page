## Overview
This project is a front-end clone of Facebook’s classic login and sign-up page interface. It faithfully reproduces the traditional layout, colors, and form structure used in the older version of Facebook. The clone is built purely with HTML and CSS for UI, and jQuery for basic form validation. It serves as a practical exercise in recreating real-world UI patterns and improving front-end development skills.
