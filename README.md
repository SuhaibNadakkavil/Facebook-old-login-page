Associated With: Brototype

Description:
As my first hands-on project in full stack development, I recreated the classic Facebook login/signup page using HTML and CSS. This project was built while following the “100K Coding Challenge” playlist on the Brototype Malayalam YouTube channel. It helped me understand layout design, form structuring, and styling fundamentals.
Currently, I'm enhancing my skills through the Brocamp 7-month offline program in Hub, focused on building real-world web applications from the ground up.

Tech Stack:

⁕ HTML
⁕ CSS
⁕ Deployed using Vercel

Key Highlights:

⁕ Fully responsive layout
⁕ Clean UI inspired by Facebook's legacy design
⁕ Strengthened my understanding of frontend structuring and UI alignment
